# How to get this thing going

Note: You'll have to have NodeJS and NPM installed. 

* First, you'll install Monaca globally by running the command `npm install -g monaca`
* Next, clone the git repo to your computer
* cd into the project directory
* run npm install
* once that finishes, run `monaca preview` to see the project in your browser
* once you see `webpack: Compiled successfully.` you can open `localhost:8000` in your browser to see the UI
